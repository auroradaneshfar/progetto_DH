	<dc:title>Portrait of Shamloo</dc:title>
	<dc:creator>Honibal Alkhas</dc:creator>
	<dc:subject>Ahmad Shamloo</dc:subject>
	<dc:description>This portrait of Shamloo is rich in content. In the bottom register, the Persian poet Ahmad Shamloo is depicted, with his own poetry written to the right. Mythological birds and women flank his sides, and continue into the upper register, surrounding a Chinese Buddhist monk sitting atop a decorative sun. The simplicity of the figures and their organization into registers evokes ancient Assyrian reliefs, and Alkhas’ dedication to his heritage as an Assyrian-Iranian.</dc:description>
